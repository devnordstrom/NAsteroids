# NAsteroids

This is a game made in Python with Pygame inspired by the original arcade game Asteroids.

The player controls a ship in space which must shoot all the asteroids on the screen to get to to the next level.

To control the ship press the up key to thrust forward, the left or right key to rotate the ship and the down key to decelerate and the space button to fire a laser bullet.
