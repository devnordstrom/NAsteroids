# NAsteroids

This is a game made in Python with Pygame inspired by the original arcade game Asteroids.

The player controls a ship which must shoot asteroids to smaller pieces and then nothing in order to survive.

To control the ship press the up key to thrust forward, the left or right 
key to rotate the ship and the down key to decelerate and the space button to fire
a laser bullet.

Sometimes slimeb lobs may also appear at the start of the level or randomly 
when an asteroid is shattered and these will follow the player.
